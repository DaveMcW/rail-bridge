A mod for [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com) that adds rail bridges.

---
### Features:

Rail bridges allow rail crossings without signals.

3 bridge types for straight and diagonal crossings.

Research Logistics 3 to unlock rail bridges.

Bridges cannot build on top of rails, mine the rails first.

---
### Known issues:

A train going over and under a bridge at the same time will collide with itself.

Trains always render on top of rail bridges.

/editor instant deconstruction does not work on rail bridges. ([72215](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=72215))
